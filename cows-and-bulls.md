## Exercise

Come up with a random 4-digit number in your code (don't worry about randomly generating it for now). Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. For every digit that the user guessed correctly and in the correct place, they have a "cow". For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a "bull." For every guess the user makes, tell them how many "cows" and "bulls" they have. Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes and tell the user at the end. 

This standard exercise is called the "cows and bulls game."
