## Exercise


NOTES:
2 part series to make a plot:
1. install numpy and bokeh. copy two lists into your file, plot it
2. read CSV file of data and plot it

In this exercise you will learn one way of displaying information visually with Python. We will take these two lists,

Given two lines of data in a CSV file, read them in and plot a few different plots in bokeh.

bokeh seems to be much easier to use than matplotlib. matplotlib is good for those coming from matlab because the syntax is similar
