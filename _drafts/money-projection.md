## Exercise

In this exercise, your goal will be to determine which bank gives you the better deal for your money after 5 years. You will open an account with $1000 at either:

1. Bank A: has no fee to open the account, and pays a 0.5% yearly interest rate, distributed monthly.
2. Bank B: has a $100 fee to open the account, and pays a 1.5% yearly interest rate, distributed monthly.
3. Bank C: has no fee to open the account, and pays a 5% yearly interest rate, distributed monthly. However, at the end of each year, the bank will take 0.05% of the money in the account as a fee for providing such a high interest rate.

Python can be used to do boring math projections! Combined with plots (exercise coming soon!), this can make money-related planning much more fun!
