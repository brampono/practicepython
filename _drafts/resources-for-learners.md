Practice Python aims to provide basic exercises for Python learners to discover Python, but it is certainly not complete. There are plenty of other resources out there online (both free and not free) that Practice Python recommends. _This page contains affiliate links._

This page contains a collection of resources for learners of Python - some are courses, some are books, some are other Python resources. If you have suggestions for what to put on this page, please contact me.

# Online courses (for free)

There are many free resources out there to help you learn Python. Often the downside of free resources is that the usability is not great, or it requires some digging to find some useful content. If you are patient, it can pay off nicely. Some of my favorites:

* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). One of my favorite online courses about Python is completely free on Codeacademy. They create great courses (with some sandboxed environments included, so no installation needed!) on a variety of programming languages, and their Python course is great.

* [OCW (OpenCourseWare) from MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu) - this initiative was started in 2001 to make public materials from courses taught at MIT. It is a collection of materials, so you are responsible for pacing yourself, finding the right materials, checking your work, etc. If you are patient enough, you can find the goldmine of materials in the entire site. My biggest beef with this website is the usability - it is really hard to find what kinds of courses you are looking for unless you know the course numbers at MIT. Fortunately, I do. Here are some free reference materials that can provide lecture notes, exercises, and the occasional video:

  * [6.189: A Gentle Introduction to Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2011/)
  * [6.00SC: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/)
  * [6.00: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/)

* [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/computer-science/python) - the natural step up from OCW, edX provides courses to teach you all the subjects of your choice. Universities are incentivized to run an online version of courses offered on college campuses. I've linked specifically to the Python course offerings, since they change on a regular basis. If you want more direction (like emails, reminders, exercises mixed in with videos, and a changing set of offerings) together with a college-level and -length course, then edX is a good place to look. They also offer verified certificates for a fee, but I have not personally done a course with verified certificates.

# Online courses (for a fee)

Another way to learn Python and programming is to pay for guided courses.

* [Treehouse](http://treehouse.7eer.net/c/348966/245646/3944) - This company makes easy, digestible courses across a variety of subjects. On top of that, Treehouse as a company has a great work philosophy, and I will happily recommend anything this company produces. To see if you like it, sign up for the free account and check it out!
* [Udemy](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xcNOXHETw7Y&offerid=323058.7&type=3&subid=0) - With hundreds of course offerings across disciplines you might never even have heard of, Udemy is a platform where subject experts create courses with videos, worksheets, and exercises. One of my favorite courses is called [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=xcNOXHETw7Y&offerid=323058.3099&type=3&subid=0), but there are many more on the platform, with even more being added daily.

# General resources

* [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/) - A friend's website visualizes the line-by-line execution of any Python program you write, directly into the browser! He recently updated the site to include other languages as well.
* [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3) - If you don't want to download a text editor, you can code Python 3 directly in the cloud! You can share your programs, and there are other supported languages.
