Exercise

Let's say you have a text-based 3x3 game board that looks like this: 



(Yep, like a tic tac toe board)

I want to be able to keep track (and re-draw) the game board every time someone makes a move. In this exercise, let's keep it simple - we won't deal with mouse clicks or anything like that. 

All you need to do is ask the user for a coordinate (like (1,1), (3,3), etc.), and re-draw the board with an "x" in that particular square. 

For example, my program will draw the board to the screen: 

 -- -- --
|  |  |  |
 -- -- -- 
|  |  |  |
 -- -- -- 
|  |  |  |
 -- -- --
