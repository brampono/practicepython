Calibrating the exercises to the audience is going to be a challenging task, so I ask you to bear with me if the exercises are too easy or too hard. Every week there will be a poll you can click on to vote whether the exercise is too easy or too hard. Hopefully after a few weeks I will get the level right. I will start with the exercise and include a discussion after, in case you want the extra challenge.

## Exercise

Take two lists, say for example these two: 

```
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
