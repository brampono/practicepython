## Problems

Practice Python is written and maintained by me, Michele Pratusevich ([personal site](http://mprat.org), [github profile](http://github.com/mprat)). The blog is published bi-weekly, with an exercise the comes out one week and a solution for that exercise that comes out the next week. As I experiment with this site over time, the frequency might become more or less frequent. If you have opinions, please feel free to let me know!

In each exercise post, I will post a small tidbit of Python 3 (an explanation, a library, a sample function) and pose an exercise that relates to the explanation / sample written in the post. The exercise should take no more than 30 minutes to solve and test. I will also try to include links to external websites that explain concepts in a simple way. The exercises will vary in difficulty from week to week. Check out the [explanation of the chili difficulty system]({{ site.baseurl }}/chilis/) for more information.

If you want to be reminded every week that a new exercise has been posted, please subscribe to this blog using your favorite RSS reader, or add your email to the email list on the [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/).

## Solutions

### Your Solution

At the bottom of every post, there will be an embedded Google Form where you will submit your solutions. The way to submit solutions will be through an anonymous Gist. This is like [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/), except I can automate some scripts to make processing solutions easier for me.

All you need to do is go to [http://gist.github.com,](http://gist.github.com) paste your code into the text box (not the comment box), and Create a Public Gist. You can even do this without a Github account! The link that is created with your code is the submission link that you will put into the form at the bottom of every exercise post. That's it! (Note: if you want to make a Github account and keep copies of your code for yourself as gists, feel free to do that as well).

### My Solution

I will post a few submitted solutions and comment on them, so you can see examples of other people's solutions. In my comments I will refer to general coding style and methodology as well as Python coding conventions. In the event that my solution differs significantly from posted solutions, I will post my solution as well. You can check your submitted solutions against the posted solutions to see how you did.
