# What is Practice Python

Practice Python was created as a side project to provide small, short, and relevant introductory Python programming exercises for beginners. When I worked for [MEET](http://meet.mit.edu/) as a computer science instructor, I had a hard time finding Python exercises that were small, self-contained, and suited for beginners. Many resources online, while thorough, were partially inaccessible to complete beginners. Mainly, the exercises were given without context. I recognized many of the problems as arbitrary and distinctly computer-sciency. They were all about sorting lists, class-design of different kinds of students, and searching through lists of strings. I wanted to provide easier problems that were more relevant to someone interested in learning Python or programming in general. Long-term, I want to provide Python resources for learners and educators alike - Pratice Python is the first step. Read more at [Why Practice Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/why-practice-python/).

# Follow along

If you like the idea of Practice Python, want to do the exercises, or just want to get notified about a new exercise or post, you have a few options:

1. Add this blog to your Feedly feed, by clicking on the link in the top right corner of the page, or clicking here. <a href='http://cloud.feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fpracticepython.org%2Fatom.xml' target='blank'><img id='feedlyFollow' src='http://s3.feedly.com/img/follows/feedly-follow-rectangle-volume-medium_2x.png' alt='follow us in feedly' width='71' height='25'></a>
2. If you don't have Feedly but use some other RSS reader, add this blog to your RSS reader by clicking the RSS icon in the top right corner of the page, or click here. <a href="{{ site.production_url }}/atom.xml" target="_blank"><img class="logo-small" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/rss_img.png" alt="Atom feed XML"></a>
3. Sign up for the Practice Python email list and get emailed every time a new exercise, solution, or post comes out. (Yes, it's still a Google Form, because it's free!)

# About the author

My name is Michele Pratusevich, and in my day job I am a research engineer. This means I do a combination of research and engineering, mostly for computer vision problems. I use Python daily, and constantly am looking for interesting Python tidbits and tricks. If you want to learn more about me, check out [my personal site](http://mprat.org). Previously, I got my bachelor of science and master's of engineering from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
