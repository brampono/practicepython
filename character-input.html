<p>Calibrating the exercises to the audience is going to be a challenging task, so I ask you to bear with me if the exercises are too easy or too hard. Every week there will be a poll you can click on to discuss whether the exercise is too easy or too hard and hopefully in a few weeks, I'll get the level right. Let's get to it! I will start with the exercise and include a discussion later, in case you want the extra challenge.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercise(s)</h2>
<p>Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.</p>
<p>Extras:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (<em>Hint: <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html">order of operations</a> exists in Python</em>)</li>
<li>Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (<em>Hint: the string &quot;&quot; is the same as pressing the ENTER button</em>)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Concepts for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting user input</li>
<li>Manipulating strings (a few ways)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-input-in-python">User input in Python</h3>
<p>To get user input in Python (3), the command you use is <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input"><code>input()</code></a>. Store the result in a variable, and use it to your heart's content. Remember that the result you get from the user will be a string, even if they enter a number.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>name = input(&quot;Give me your name: &quot;)
print &quot;Your name is &quot; + name</code></pre>
<p>What this will print in the terminal (or the shell, whatever you are running Python in) will be:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Give me your name: Michele
Your name is Michele</code></pre>
<p>What happens at the end of <code>input()</code> is that it waits for the user to type something and press ENTER. Only after the user presses ENTER does the program continue.</p>
<h3 id="manipulating-strings-a-few-ways">Manipulating strings (a few ways)</h3>
<p>What you get from the <code>input()</code> function is a string. What can you do with it?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make the string into a number. Let's say you are 100% positive that the user entered a number. You can turn the string into an integer with the function <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#int"><code>int()</code></a>. (In a later exercise or two or three there will be questions about what to do when the user does NOT enter a number and you try to do this; for now don't worry about that problem). Here is what this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>age = input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;)
age = int(age)</code></pre>
<p>(or, if you want to be more compact with your code)</p>
<pre><code>age = int(input(&quot;Enter your age: &quot;))</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, <code>age</code> will hold a variable that is an integer, and now you can do math with it.</p>
<p>(Note, you can also turn integers into strings exactly in the opposite way, using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#str"><code>str()</code></a> function)</p></li>
<li><p>Doing math with strings. What do I mean by that? I mean, if I want to combine (<strong>concatenate</strong> is the computer science word for this) strings, all I need to do is add them:</p>
<pre><code>print &quot;Were&quot; + &quot;wolf&quot;
print &quot;Door&quot; + &quot;man&quot;
print &quot;4&quot; + &quot;chan&quot;
print str(4) + &quot;chan&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The same works for multiplication, but division and subtraction do not work like this.</p></li>
</ol>
