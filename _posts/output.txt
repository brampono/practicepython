<p>Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.</p>
<p>Extra:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.</li>
</ul>
