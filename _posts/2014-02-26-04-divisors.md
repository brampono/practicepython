## Exercise

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don't know what a _divisor_ is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

## Discussion 

The topics that you need for this exercise combine lists, conditionals, and user input. There is a new concept of creating lists. 

There is an easy way to programmatically create lists of numbers in Python. 

To create a list of numbers from 2 to 10, just use the following code: 

```
x = range(2, 11)
```

Then the variable `x` will contain the list `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. Note that the second number in the `range()` function is not included in the original list. 

Now that `x` is a list of numbers, the same for loop can be used with the list: 

```
for elem in x: 
	print elem
```

Will yield the result: 

```
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

Happy coding!
