## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/04/guessing-game-1.html)

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (_Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very [first exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/01/exercise-1-input-and-strings.html!_)

Extras: 

* Keep the game going until the user types "exit"
* Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


## Sample solution

Great example of a solution including both extras!
