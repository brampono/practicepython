## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/05/list-remove-duplicates.html)

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates. 

Extras: 

* Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
* Go back and do [Exercise 5](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/03/exercise-5-list-overlap.html) using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

## Sample solution

This solution has two different functions doing the solution in two ways - one does it with a loop, and one with sets!
