## [Exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-05-15-14-list-remove-duplicates %})

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates. 

Extras: 

* Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
* Go back and do [Exercise 5]({% post_url 2014-03-05-05-list-overlap %}) using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

## Sample solution

This solution has two different functions doing the solution in two ways - one does it with a loop, and one with sets!
