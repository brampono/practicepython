## Exercise

Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, `a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

## Concepts to practice

* Lists and properties of lists
* List comprehensions (maybe)
* Functions

## Happy coding!
