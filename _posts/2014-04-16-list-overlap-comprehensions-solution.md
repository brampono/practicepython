## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/04/list-overlap-comprehensions.html)

This week's exercise was an old exercise (see [Exercise 5](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/03/exercise-5-list-overlap.html)), requiring the solution in a different way. 

Take two lists, say for example these two: 

```
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of Python.

Extra: 

* Randomly generate two lists to test this


## Sample solution

Great example of a solution including the extras!
