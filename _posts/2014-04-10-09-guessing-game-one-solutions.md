Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (_Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very [first exercise]({% post_url 2014-01-29-01-character-input %})_).

Extras: 

* Keep the game going until the user types "exit"
* Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


## Sample solution
