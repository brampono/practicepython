## [Exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-04-02-09-guessing-game-one %})

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (_Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very [first exercise]({% post_url 2014-01-29-01-character-input %}_)

Extras: 

* Keep the game going until the user types "exit"
* Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


## Sample solution

Great example of a solution including both extras!
