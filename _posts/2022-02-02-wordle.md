title: A Python Wordle Clone
categories: [blog]

When learning how to program, I always recommend having a project or application in mind. For me, it makes it easier to concentrate and learn specific skills and flex the critical thinking muscle. What better project to attempt than the latest game craze, [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)? In this post-essay, I'll take you through the steps required to write your own version of Wordle on the command-line.

To make it even more fun (and of course, a tad embarassing for me), I screen-captured myself programming wordle, unedited, for those interested in watching.

## Structure

This post-essay will take you through the steps and components required to program a Worldle clone in Python (on the command-line, without a GUI), and we'll use this as a use case for what is required to build a medium-sized project. Some parts will be quite boring (for example, planning and gathering requirements), but I hope to use this as a use case to showcase what kinds of work software developers do every day.

First, we'll go through the requirements of our project (the Wordle clone) and put them into a list. Next, we'll tackle each item one by one.

## Requirements

Before starting any programming project, it is important to make a list of all the features you want it to have. This accomplishes two things: (1) gives you a "stopping point" to know when you're done, and (2) lets you organize your thoughts to make sure your choices for how to implement cover all your use cases.

In our case, for a Python command-line clone of Wordle, here is our requirements and features list:
