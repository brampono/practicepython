## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/04/check-primality-function.html)

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to [Exercise 4](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/02/divisors.html) to help you. 

## Sample solution

There are many ways of solving this problem, so here are a sample solutions:

The first, one possibility for using functions:

And this one is a different breakdown of functions to solve the problem. The strings between three `'''` marks are comments in the code that describe what each function does.

And here is a solution without using functions. It is also a correct solution that accomplishes the given task, just without the use of functions.
