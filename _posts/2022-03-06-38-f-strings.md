## Exercise

Implement the same exercise as [Exercise 1]({% post_url 2014-01-29-01-character-input %}) (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old), except use f-strings instead of the `+` operator to print the resulting output message.

## Discussion

One very common operation programmers need to do is display information in the form of text output. In Python we use the `print()` function for this, but we need to keep one thing in mind: the `print()` function only takes strings. That means, when we want to display an integer, we need to convert it to a string before passing it to the `print()` function. When we have complicated numbers to display, this becomes burdensome.

Instead, there is a built-in Python functionality called [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals), short for _formatted string literals_ that solve the problem for us!
