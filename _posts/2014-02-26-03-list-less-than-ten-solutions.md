Take a list, say for example this one: 

{% highlight python %}
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
{% endhighlight %}

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras: 

1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list `a` that are smaller than that number given by the user. 

## Sample solution

I will note that none of the solutions that were submitted were written in one line of Python. There will be more exercises later that show you how to do this!

Here is a sample solution that solves the exercise, including extras 1 and 2.

And here is a sample solution that solves the exercise with extra 3.
