Practice Python is doing well with exercises, solutions, comments, etc. But it needs more! So, I have set up a blog section of Practice Python, which will be updated whenever I have something interesting to say about Python!

## Launching the blog

The bread and butter of Practice Python is exercises and solutions. Once in a while there are topics or discussions I want to share with readers of the site that can't be formatted in exercise / solution form.

The blog will be updated whenever I have something interesting to say about Python, or if a guest poster has something fun they want to share with the audience of Practice Python.

If you subscribe to the Practice Python RSS feed, email list, or Twitter feed, you will get notified whenever a new blog post has been put up, the same way as exercises and solutions notify you now.

I hope you enjoy it!
