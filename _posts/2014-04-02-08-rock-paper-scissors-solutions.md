I was slightly disappointed by how few people attempted the exercise this week - try it, it's a fun one, and look at the sample solutions if you are stuck. Feel free to reach out to me personally if you want more personalized help.

## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.com/2014/03/list-comprehensions.html)

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (_Hint: Ask for player plays (using `input`), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game_)

Remember the rules: 

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beats paper
* Paper beats rock
