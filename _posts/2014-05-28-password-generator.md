## Exercise

Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method. 

Extra:
 
 * Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

## Discussion

There are no new topics this week, but you will need to use [Python's random module](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/random.html), described in [this post](http://practicepython.blogspot.co.il/2014/04/exercise-9-randomness-guessing-game.html). 
 
## Happy coding!
