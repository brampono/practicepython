title: Python 2 or 3? Beginners shouldn't care!
categories: [blog]
---

When you are starting to learn Python, you have to decide whether to learn Python 2 or Python 3. Good news is, when you're starting out, it doesn't matter! In beginner code, the differences are minimal - in this post we will discuss the 3 differences beginners will notice: print, input, and division. Why is it different and why is it a problem? The _interpreters_ are different!

# Python 2 vs Python 3

The debate continues and will continue into the forseeable future: do I learn Python 2 or Python 3? I believe you should learn Python 3 (and if you want to read a more detailed discussion of why, I wrote about it [in my introductory post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-12-30-why-practice-python %})). Instead, I want to talk about how you can add a few lines to simple Python 3 code (which this site uses in the examples) that will let you run the code through Python 2.

# Interpreters

First, a quick word on _interpreters_. What is an interpreter? In English the word _interpreter_ means someone or something that can extract meaning out from words or text. In Python it is the same thing - the Python _interpreter_ translates your Python code that looks something like this:

{% highlight python %}
month = "December"
day = "06"
year = "2016"
print("The date is: {} {}, {}".format(month, day, year))
{% endhighlight %}

Into code that a computer can interpret <sup>1</sup>, like this:

{% highlight text %}
01000100100001
00001010010111
10111101010101
01001010101001
{% endhighlight %}

<sup>1</sup> _I have no idea if the code compiles to this lovely sequence of 0s and 1s. It is just an illustration._

When you run a Python program through the Python shell, through hitting "play" in IDLE, or by running `python3` in the command line, what you are doing is telling the interpreter to start translating.

How does this relate to Python 2 and Python 3? Well, Python 2 and Python 3 are the same language, but they rely on slightly different interpreters to translate. For example, a _syntax difference_ between Python 2 and 3 is how you print something to the screen. In Python 2 you do `print "Michele"` but in Python 3 you do `print("Michele")`. The meaning is the same but the way you write it is different. The syntax for Python 2 is not understood by the Python 3 interpreter, and vice versa. The other kind of difference is an _interpretation difference_ - the syntax is the same, but the meaning is different. An example is division, which we will discuss below. Both kinds of differences cause errors in your program, and you must be aware of it.

Let's talk about the 3 small differences you as a beginner will notice.

# Syntax differences between Python 2 and Python 3

For beginners, there are a few important differences (both in syntax and interpretation) between Python 2 and Python 3. We will discuss 3 of them here:

1. printing to the screen (_syntax_)
2. user input (_syntax_)
2. division (_interpretation_)

There are many many manyy more small differences that I won't get into, mostly because they won't affect you being able to get your hands dirty with Python! If you want to read more about the changes to the Python language introduced in the various versions of Python 3, I have included links to each of the changelogs from Python 3.0 to Python 3.6 [here](#readmore).

## Printing

The first difference most people will notice between Python 2 and Python 3 is printing information to the screen. The difference is straightforward:

<table style="border-spacing: 10px; padding: 10px; margin: 0 auto;">
	<thead>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<th style="border-right: 1px solid black;">Python 2</th>
			<th>Python 3</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
{% highlight python %}
print "my string"
{% endhighlight %}
			</td>
			<td>
{% highlight python %}
print("my string")
{% endhighlight %}			
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


In Python 2, `print` is an _operator_, which means it operates on whatever comes after it. In Python 3, `print` is a function that takes an argument. 

So if you get an error like this:

{% highlight python %}
>>> print "Michele"
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print "Michele"
                  ^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
{% endhighlight %}

It means you were trying to use Python 2 `print` syntax in Python 3. Just add parentheses and you're good to go. Fortunately, this capability has been back-ported to Python 2, so you can run Python 3 print statements through Python 2 and you should be all set. In case you want to be extra sure, if you are running code through a Python 2 interpreter, just add the following import to the header:

{% highlight python %}
from __future__ import printfunction
{% endhighlight %}

It will make sure you can run `print` as a function in Python 2.

## User input

The next difference a beginner will notice is the function that is used to take in user input. In Python 2, the `raw_input()` function was used. However, this function is removed in Python 3 and is replaced with the `input()` function instead. Beware - the `input()` function existed in Python 2 as well, but it was a LOT less useful, and had wrong unexpected behavior.

If you try to use `raw_input()` in your Python 3 programs, you will get an error like this:

{% highlight python %}
>>> raw_input("input something: ")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
{% endhighlight %}

So use `input()` instead.

## Division

The default division behavior is different between Python 2 and 3.

<table style="border-spacing: 10px; padding: 10px; margin: 0 auto;">
	<thead>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<th style="border-right: 1px solid black; padding: 15px;">Python 2</th>
			<th>Python 3</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
{% highlight python %}
>>> 2 / 3
0
{% endhighlight %}
			</td>
			<td>
{% highlight python %}
>>> 2 / 3
0.666666
{% endhighlight %}			
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

In Python 2, the division is integer division - two integers that are divided must return an integer, and the convention is that this is done with the `floor()` function, or that the integer returned from the division is just the integer part, not rounded. In Python 3, two integers divided can return a decimal. Strangely, if you do `2.0 / 3` in Python 2, the result will be `0.6666666` as you expect. But remembering to add the `.0` at the end is hard, and can lead to errors in your programs.

Instead, to make Python 2 division behave just like Python 3 division, just add the following import to your program to take advantage of the fact that Python's future (i.e. Python 3) has fixed this annoyance:

{% highlight python %}
from __future__ import division
{% endhighlight %}

Yes, we are learning division from the future.

# Summary

For beginners, we talked about 3 small syntax and interpretation differences between Python 2 and Python 3. The differences are so small, that you shouldn't debate about which to learn! Here are the differences summarized in a single table:

<table style="border-spacing: 10px; padding: 5px; margin: 0 auto;">
	<thead>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<th></th>
			<th style="border-right: 1px solid black;">Python 2</th>
			<th>Python 3</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
Printing
			</td>
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
{% highlight python %}
print "my string"
{% endhighlight %}
			</td>
			<td>
{% highlight python %}
print("my string")
{% endhighlight %}			
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
User input
			</td>
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
{% highlight python %}
raw_input()
{% endhighlight %}
			</td>
			<td>
{% highlight python %}
input()
{% endhighlight %}			
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
Division
			</td>
			<td style="border-right: 1px solid black;">
{% highlight python %}
>>> 2 / 3
0
{% endhighlight %}
			</td>
			<td>
{% highlight python %}
>>> 2 / 3
0.666666
{% endhighlight %}			
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

And, in case you have Python 2 but want to run the code examples from this blog (which are in Python 3), all you need to do is add a few imports to the top of your Python 2 code for your Python 2 interpreter:

{% highlight python %}
from __future__ import division, printfunction
{% endhighlight %}
