## [Exercise](http://practicepython.blogspot.co.il/2014/05/exercise-14-reverse-word-order.html)

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string: 

```
My name is Michele
```

Then I would see the string: 

```
Michele is name My
```

shown back to me.

## Sample solution

Here is the quick, one-liner solution to the problem:

But most likely you didn't come up with that solution right away. You most likely went through a number of iterations like this:

But you also could have taken a hybrid approach:
