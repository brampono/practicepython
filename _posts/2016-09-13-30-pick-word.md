## Exercise

_This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other 2 exercises are: [Part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/comingsoon) and [Part 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/comingsoon)._

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the [SOWPODS dictionary](http://norvig.com/ngrams/sowpods.txt).

_Hint: use the Python `os` library for reading the file and the `random` library for picking a random word._

### Aside: what is SOWPODS

SOWPODS is a word list commonly used in word puzzles and games (like Scrabble for example). It is the combination of the Scrabble Player's Dictionary and the Chamber's Dictionary. (The history of SOWPODS is quite interesting, I highly recommend reading the [Wikipedia article if you are curious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOWPODS).)
